CAW at the beginning was a tumor/normal pair analysis workflow.
But it could do germline and somatic analysis.
And as it could be confusing using a Cancer Analysis Workflow for germline analysis only.

It was decided to change name for the project.
The new name is Sarek, after the [Sarek National Park <i class="fab fa-wikipedia-w" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarek_National_Park) in northen Sweden.

The github [repository <i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/SciLifeLab/Sarek) has been renamed, but GitHub does the redirection unless there is another project with the same name. Pretty smart ;-)
