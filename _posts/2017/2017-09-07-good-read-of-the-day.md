Interesting read of the day by the excellent Carl Zimmer: [Letâ€™s Not Lose Our Minds <i class="fab fa-medium" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://medium.com/@carlzimmer/lets-not-lose-our-minds-c5dcac29e97f)

He makes a beautiful parallel between Lysenko and his view controlling the research in genetics during the USSR old days and current situation in the USA with climate change.

A little long, but it's definitely worth reading.
